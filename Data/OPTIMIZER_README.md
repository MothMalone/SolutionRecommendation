# Optimization-Based Pipeline Recommender

## Overview

This document explains the new optimization-based recommender that uses **Bayesian Optimization (SMAC3)** to construct custom preprocessing pipelines by searching through a configuration space of ~10,000 possible combinations.

---

## üéØ What Problem Does This Solve?

### The Limitation of Fixed Pipelines

Previously, we had **12 predefined pipelines** (baseline, simple_preprocess, robust_preprocess, etc.). The recommender could only select ONE of these 12 options per dataset.

**Problem**: What if the optimal pipeline for a dataset is NOT in our predefined set?

For example:
- Dataset A might need: `mean imputation + robust scaling + no outlier removal`
- But none of our 12 pipelines has this exact combination
- The recommender is forced to pick the "closest" match, which may be suboptimal

### The Solution: Optimization-Based Search

The new optimizer **constructs custom pipelines** by searching the full configuration space. It can recommend ANY valid combination of the 6 pipeline components, not just the 12 we predefined.

---

## üîß How It Works

### Step 1: Configuration Space

The optimizer can mix and match from these components:

```python
Configuration Space:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ imputation: [none, mean, median, most_frequent, knn, constant] (6 options)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scaling: [none, standard, minmax, robust, maxabs] (5 options)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encoding: [none, onehot] (2 options)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_selection: [none, variance_threshold, k_best, mutual_info] (4 options)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outlier_removal: [none, iqr, zscore, isolation_forest, lof] (5 options)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dimensionality_reduction: [none, pca, svd] (3 options)

Total combinations: 6 √ó 5 √ó 2 √ó 4 √ó 5 √ó 3 = 3,600 possible pipelines
```

This is **300√ó larger** than the 12 predefined pipelines!

### Step 2: Learning from Existing Data

The optimizer learns from two data sources:

1. **`preprocessed_performance.csv`** - Performance matrix
   - Shows how each of the 12 predefined pipelines performed on 90 training datasets
   - Format: 12 rows (pipelines) √ó 90 columns (datasets)
   - Values: Accuracy scores (0.0 to 1.0)

2. **`dataset_feats.csv`** - Dataset metafeatures
   - Contains 107 metafeatures describing each dataset
   - Examples: num_features, num_instances, class_imbalance, missing_ratio, etc.
   - Format: 2,560 rows (datasets) √ó 107 columns (features)

### Step 3: Surrogate Model Training

The optimizer builds a **surrogate model** (Random Forest) that predicts:

```
performance = f(dataset_metafeatures, pipeline_configuration)
```

**Training Process**:
1. For each (dataset, pipeline) pair in the performance matrix:
   - Get dataset's metafeatures: `[num_features=20, num_instances=1000, ...]`
   - Encode pipeline configuration: `[imputation=1, scaling=2, encoding=1, ...]`
   - Combine them: `[num_features, num_instances, ..., imputation, scaling, ...]`
   - Target: The accuracy score from the performance matrix

2. Train Random Forest on these examples:
   - Input: Dataset metafeatures + Pipeline encoding (107 + 6 = 113 features)
   - Output: Predicted accuracy score
   - Training size: 90 datasets √ó 12 pipelines = 1,080 examples

**What The Surrogate Learns**:
- "Datasets with many features (>100) benefit from `dimensionality_reduction='pca'`"
- "Imbalanced datasets work better with `outlier_removal='isolation_forest'`"
- "Datasets with missing values need `imputation='knn'` rather than `'mean'`"
- "High-dimensional sparse data prefers `scaling='maxabs'` over `'standard'`"

### Step 4: Bayesian Optimization (SMAC3)

For each test dataset, the optimizer runs **Bayesian Optimization** to find the best pipeline:

```python
# Pseudocode for optimization
for each test_dataset:
    1. Get dataset metafeatures: [num_features=50, num_instances=500, ...]
    
    2. Initialize SMAC3 optimizer
    
    3. For 50 iterations:
        a. SMAC suggests a pipeline configuration to try
           Example: {imputation='median', scaling='robust', ...}
        
        b. Encode this configuration as a numerical vector
           [imputation=2, scaling=3, encoding=1, ...]
        
        c. Combine with dataset metafeatures
           [num_features, num_instances, ..., imputation, scaling, ...]
        
        d. Predict performance using surrogate Random Forest
           predicted_accuracy = surrogate.predict(combined_features)
        
        e. SMAC updates its belief about which regions are promising
           Uses Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function
    
    4. Return the best pipeline found after 50 evaluations
```

**Why Bayesian Optimization?**
- **Efficient**: Only needs 50 evaluations instead of testing all 3,600 combinations
- **Smart**: Uses predictions to decide where to search next (not random)
- **Adaptive**: Balances exploration (trying new areas) vs exploitation (refining good areas)

**The Acquisition Function (Expected Improvement)**:
- Predicts how much better a configuration MIGHT be than current best
- Considers both predicted performance AND uncertainty
- Explores high-uncertainty regions that MIGHT be better
- Exploits high-confidence regions that ARE better

## üöÄ Usage

### Training the Optimizer

```bash
# Train the optimizer as a recommender type
python recommender_trainer.py --recommender optimizer

# This will:
# 1. Load preprocessed_performance.csv (12√ó90)
# 2. Load dataset_feats.csv (metafeatures)
# 3. Train surrogate Random Forest on (metafeatures, pipeline) ‚Üí performance
# 4. Save the trained optimizer model
```

### Evaluating the Optimizer

```bash
# Evaluate optimizer on test datasets
python evaluate_optimizer.py

# With more optimization evaluations (better results but slower)
python evaluate_optimizer.py --n-trials 100

# Skip the educational explanation
python evaluate_optimizer.py --no-explain
```

### What the Evaluation Does

The evaluation script compares the optimizer against the 12 predefined pipelines:

1. **Loads Data**:
   - Training: `preprocessed_performance.csv` + `dataset_feats.csv`
   - Test: `test_ground_truth_performance.csv`

2. **Trains Surrogate**: Learns performance prediction model

3. **For Each Test Dataset**:
   - Runs SMAC optimization (50 evaluations)
   - Finds best custom pipeline
   - Checks if it matches a predefined pipeline (rediscovery)
   - Or if it's truly novel (exploration)
   - Compares performance rank

4. **Outputs**:
   - Discovery analysis: Novel vs rediscovered pipelines
   - Performance metrics: Average rank, Top-1/Top-3 accuracy
   - Saves results to `optimizer_evaluation_results.csv`

---

## üìà Expected Results

### Possible Outcomes

1. **Rediscovery**: Optimizer finds a predefined pipeline
   - Shows that our predefined set captures common patterns
   - Can directly compare performance rank

2. **Novel Discovery**: Optimizer finds a new combination
   - Shows the benefit of searching larger space
   - Would need actual evaluation to verify performance

### Performance Metrics

The evaluation reports:
- **Average Rank**: Where optimizer's pipeline ranks among 12 predefined (lower is better)
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: % of times optimizer finds the best pipeline
- **Top-3 Accuracy**: % of times optimizer is in top 3
- **Discovery Rate**: % of novel vs rediscovered pipelines

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

**Surrogate Modeling**:
```python
# Expensive: Actually evaluate pipeline on dataset
true_score = evaluate_pipeline(dataset, pipeline)  # Takes minutes

# Cheap: Predict performance using surrogate
predicted_score = surrogate.predict(metafeatures + pipeline_encoding)  # Takes milliseconds
```

**Expected Improvement**:
```python
# For each candidate pipeline:
mean_prediction = surrogate.predict(config)
uncertainty = surrogate.predict_std(config)

# Expected Improvement balances both:
EI = (mean_prediction - current_best) * probability_of_improvement(uncertainty)

# High EI when:
# - Mean prediction is high (exploitation)
# - Uncertainty is high (exploration)
```

**Configuration Encoding**:
```python
# Convert categorical pipeline to numerical features
pipeline = {
    'imputation': 'median',      # ‚Üí 2
    'scaling': 'robust',         # ‚Üí 3
    'encoding': 'onehot',        # ‚Üí 1
    'feature_selection': 'none', # ‚Üí 0
    'outlier_removal': 'zscore', # ‚Üí 2
    'dimensionality_reduction': 'none'  # ‚Üí 0
}

# Encoded as: [2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0]
# Combined with dataset metafeatures: [n_features, n_instances, ..., 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0]
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why not just grid search all 3,600 combinations?
**A**: Too expensive! Each evaluation would require training AutoGluon on the full dataset. 3,600 evaluations √ó 10 minutes = 600 hours. Bayesian optimization finds good solutions in just 50 evaluations.

### Q: How accurate is the surrogate model?
**A**: It learns from 1,080 examples (90 datasets √ó 12 pipelines). May not be perfectly accurate, but good enough to guide search toward promising regions.

### Q: What if the optimizer finds a bad pipeline?
**A**: The surrogate might make mistakes, especially for novel combinations it hasn't seen. This is why we evaluate against ground truth and compare rankings.

### Q: Can I use this for my own datasets?
**A**: Yes! The optimizer learns general patterns about which preprocessing helps which dataset types. It should transfer to new datasets with similar characteristics.

### Q: How do I know if a novel pipeline is actually better?
**A**: You'd need to evaluate it by running AutoGluon with that pipeline on the dataset. The surrogate prediction gives an estimate, but actual evaluation confirms it.

### Q: Why Random Forest as surrogate?
**A**: Random Forests are good for:
- Handling mixed numerical/categorical features
- Providing uncertainty estimates
- Being robust to hyperparameters
- Fast prediction for optimization
