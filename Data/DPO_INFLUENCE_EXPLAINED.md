# 🎯 DPO-Inspired Influence Weighting for Hybrid Recommender

## What is DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)?

**DPO** is a technique from reinforcement learning that learns from **preference comparisons** rather than absolute scores. The key insight: **not all training examples are equally valuable** - some teach the model more effectively than others.

### Core Principle
Instead of treating all data equally, DPO **weights training samples** based on how informative they are. More informative samples get higher weights, making the model learn more from them.

## Our Implementation: 3-Component Influence Score

We adapt DPO principles to dataset recommendation by calculating influence scores based on three components:

### Component 1: Discriminative Power (50% weight) 🎯

**Question:** *Does this dataset clearly separate good pipelines from bad ones?*

**Why it matters:** Datasets with clear winners/losers teach the model what works and what doesn't. Ambiguous datasets (where all pipelines perform similarly) provide little learning signal.

**How we measure it:**
```python
# Calculate gap between top-3 and bottom-3 pipelines
top_3_mean = sorted_performances[-3:].mean()
bottom_3_mean = sorted_performances[:3].mean()
gap = top_3_mean - bottom_3_mean

# Penalize if top-3 or bottom-3 have high variance (unclear signal)
top_3_std = sorted_performances[-3:].std()
bottom_3_std = sorted_performances[:3].std()

discriminative_power = gap / (1.0 + top_3_std + bottom_3_std)
```

**Example:**
- **High discriminative power** (0.8): 
  - Top-3 pipelines: [0.95, 0.94, 0.93] (clear winners)
  - Bottom-3 pipelines: [0.45, 0.42, 0.40] (clear losers)
  - Gap: 0.50, Low variance within groups
  
- **Low discriminative power** (0.2):
  - Top-3: [0.68, 0.65, 0.64] (mediocre)
  - Bottom-3: [0.58, 0.55, 0.54] (also mediocre)
  - Gap: 0.10, All pipelines perform similarly

### Component 2: Information Gain (30% weight) 📚

**Question:** *Is this dataset unique? Does it teach us something new?*

**Why it matters:** Datasets similar to many others provide redundant information. Unique datasets expand the model's knowledge.

**How we measure it:**
```python
# Calculate median distance to all other datasets in metafeature space
distances = []
for other_dataset in all_datasets:
    dist = euclidean_distance(dataset_features, other_dataset_features)
    distances.append(dist)

information_gain = median(distances)  # Higher = more unique
```

**Example:**
- **High information gain** (0.9):
  - Dataset has 10,000 features (very high-dimensional)
  - Most other datasets have <100 features
  - Metafeatures are far from the cluster center
  
- **Low information gain** (0.2):
  - Dataset has 50 features, 1000 samples (common)
  - Many similar datasets already in training set
  - Metafeatures close to average

### Component 3: Reliability Score (20% weight) ✅

**Question:** *Is the performance signal consistent and trustworthy?*

**Why it matters:** Noisy datasets mislead the model. We want clean, reliable signals to learn from.

**How we measure it:**
```python
# Low variance relative to range = reliable patterns
performance_range = performances.max() - performances.min()
performance_variance = performances.var()

reliability = 1.0 - min(1.0, performance_variance / performance_range)

# Also check coefficient of variation (normalized variance)
cv = performances.std() / performances.mean()
reliability = (reliability + 1.0/(1.0 + cv)) / 2.0
```

**Example:**
- **High reliability** (0.85):
  - Performances: [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55] (smooth gradient)
  - Low noise, clear ranking
  
- **Low reliability** (0.3):
  - Performances: [0.8, 0.3, 0.9, 0.4, 0.7] (erratic, noisy)
  - High variance, unclear patterns

## Aggregation & Scaling

### Method Selection

You can choose different influence methods via `--influence-method`:

1. **`performance_variance`** (Simple baseline)
   ```python
   influence = variance(performances)
   ```
   Higher variance = more informative

2. **`discriminative_power`** (DPO-inspired, component 1 only)
   ```python
   influence = discriminative_power_score
   ```
   Focus on datasets with clear winners/losers

3. **`data_diversity`** (Component 2 only)
   ```python
   influence = information_gain_score
   ```
   Focus on unique datasets

4. **`combined`** (Full DPO - RECOMMENDED ⭐)
   ```python
   influence = 0.5 * discriminative_power + 
               0.3 * information_gain + 
               0.2 * reliability
   ```
   Balanced combination of all factors

### Exponential Scaling (DPO-Style)

After calculating raw influence scores, we apply **exponential weighting** to emphasize differences:

```python
# Step 1: Normalize to [0, 1]
scores = (scores - min) / (max - min)

# Step 2: Apply exponential transformation (DPO signature)
beta = 2.0  # Sharpness parameter
scores = exp(beta * scores)

# Step 3: Re-normalize to [0, 1]
scores = (scores - min) / (max - min)

# Step 4: Scale to [0.1, 3.0] for 30x dynamic range
scores = 0.1 + (scores * 2.9)
```

**Why exponential?** 
- Linear weighting: [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0] → modest differences
- Exponential: [1.0, 4.48, 7.39, 12.18, 20.09] → dramatic differences

This ensures high-influence datasets dominate training, while low-influence datasets have minimal impact.

## How It Affects Recommendations

### During Training (Hybrid Recommender)

The hybrid recommender trains:
1. **KNN model** on dataset metafeatures
2. **XGBoost model** on (metafeatures + pipeline_features) → performance

Influence scores don't directly affect XGBoost training (all samples used), but they **dramatically affect KNN-based recommendations**.

### During Recommendation

When recommending for a new dataset:

```python
# Step 1: Find K nearest neighbors
neighbors = knn.find_neighbors(new_dataset)
distances = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]  # Example distances

# Step 2: Calculate similarity weights (inverse distance)
weights = 1.0 / (distances + 1e-8)
weights = [10.0, 3.33, 2.0, 1.43, 1.11]

# Step 3: Apply influence weighting
neighbor_ids = [45, 67, 12, 89, 34]
influences = [2.8, 1.5, 0.8, 0.3, 0.2]  # From DPO calculation

influence_weighted_weights = weights * influences
# Result: [28.0, 5.0, 1.6, 0.43, 0.22]

# Step 4: Renormalize
final_weights = influence_weighted_weights / sum(influence_weighted_weights)
# Result: [0.796, 0.142, 0.045, 0.012, 0.006]
```

**Impact:** Dataset 45 (high influence) now has **79.6%** of the voting weight, even though it was only slightly closer than others!

### Example Scenario

**Without Influence Weighting:**
```
New dataset: Credit card fraud detection (imbalanced, 500k samples)

Nearest neighbors:
  1. Dataset 45 (distance=0.1, weight=10.0, vote=28.6%) → Best pipeline: XGBoost
  2. Dataset 67 (distance=0.3, weight=3.3, vote=9.4%)  → Best pipeline: Random Forest
  3. Dataset 12 (distance=0.5, weight=2.0, vote=5.7%)  → Best pipeline: XGBoost
  4. Dataset 89 (distance=0.7, weight=1.4, vote=4.0%)  → Best pipeline: Logistic Regression
  5. Dataset 34 (distance=0.9, weight=1.1, vote=3.1%)  → Best pipeline: SVM

Weighted vote:
  - XGBoost: 28.6% + 5.7% = 34.3%
  - Random Forest: 9.4%
  - Logistic Regression: 4.0%
  
→ Recommends XGBoost (but close call)
```

**With DPO Influence Weighting:**
```
New dataset: Credit card fraud detection (imbalanced, 500k samples)

Nearest neighbors (with influence scores):
  1. Dataset 45 (dist=0.1, weight=10.0, influence=2.8, vote=79.6%) → XGBoost
     [High discriminative power: XGBoost scored 0.95, others <0.60]
     [Unique: Large imbalanced dataset, rare in training set]
     
  2. Dataset 67 (dist=0.3, weight=3.3, influence=1.5, vote=14.2%) → Random Forest
     [Medium discriminative power]
     
  3. Dataset 12 (dist=0.5, weight=2.0, influence=0.8, vote=4.5%) → XGBoost
     [Low discriminative power: all pipelines scored 0.70-0.75]
     
  4. Dataset 89 (dist=0.7, weight=1.4, influence=0.3, vote=1.2%) → Logistic Regression
     [Very noisy, unreliable signal]
     
  5. Dataset 34 (dist=0.9, weight=1.1, influence=0.2, vote=0.6%) → SVM
     [Redundant dataset, similar to many others]

Weighted vote:
  - XGBoost: 79.6% + 4.5% = 84.1% ⭐
  - Random Forest: 14.2%
  - Logistic Regression: 1.2%
  
→ Recommends XGBoost with HIGH CONFIDENCE
```

**Key Difference:** 
- Without DPO: 34.3% vote for XGBoost (uncertain)
- With DPO: 84.1% vote for XGBoost (very confident)

The model learned to **trust** Dataset 45 much more because:
1. It clearly showed XGBoost >>> others (discriminative)
2. It's a unique large imbalanced dataset (informative)
3. The signal is consistent and reliable
